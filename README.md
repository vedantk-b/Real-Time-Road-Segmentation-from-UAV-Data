# Real-Time-Road-Segmentation-from-UAV-Data
The goal is to segment out roads on a gazebo world using video captured by a drone for UGV to drive autonomously.  I gathered the data by taking the video footage form the drone and the annotating it using the CVAT online tool. I used the UNET model with MobileNetV2 encoder with parallel processing using multiple GPUs in Pytorch to train the model. â—¦ The model achieved an accuracy of 99% on training data with an inference time of 120ms.
